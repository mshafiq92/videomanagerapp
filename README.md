## Project Documentation

Introduction

This repository holds the documentation and setup for a containerized FastAPI application with MongoDB integration.
It includes:

Dockerfile ‚Üí builds the application image

docker-compose.yaml ‚Üí orchestrates the container setup

Both files are explained line by line, with short comments for clarity.

üöÄ Dockerfile ‚Äì Building Your Application Image

Think of the Dockerfile as a recipe that tells Docker how to build the image for your application.

Line-by-Line Breakdown

FROM python:3.12-slim

Base image with Python 3.12 in a lightweight environment.

Smaller than full Python image ‚Üí saves space.

WORKDIR /app

Sets /app as the working directory inside the container.

Like cd /app but permanent for the container.

COPY requirements.txt .

Copies requirements.txt to /app/.

Copied first for layer caching optimization.

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

Installs dependencies like FastAPI, Uvicorn, Motor, etc.

Executed at build time.

COPY app/ ./app/

Copies entire app folder into the container.

COPY .env .

Copies environment variables file into the container.

EXPOSE 8000

Documents that the app uses port 8000.

Note: Only documentation. Actual mapping happens in docker-compose.yaml.

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

Runs FastAPI with Uvicorn server when container starts.

üìÑ Updated Dockerfile with Comments

# Use lightweight Python 3.12 base image

FROM python:3.12-slim

# Set working directory inside container

WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements first (better Docker layer caching)

COPY requirements.txt .

# Install Python dependencies

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code

COPY app/ ./app/

# Copy environment variables file

COPY .env .

# Document that app uses port 8000

EXPOSE 8000

# Start FastAPI app with Uvicorn server

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

‚öôÔ∏è docker-compose.yaml ‚Äì Orchestrating Containers

Docker Compose manages multiple containers and their configurations.

Line-by-Line Breakdown

version: "3.8"

File format version, widely supported.

services:

Defines all containers to run.

video-manager:

Main service for the FastAPI app.

Name becomes the container name + network hostname.

build: .

Builds image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.

ports: - "8000:8000"

Maps host port 8000 ‚Üí container port 8000.

Lets you access the app at <http://localhost:8000>.

environment: - MONGO_URI=${MONGO_URI}

Passes MongoDB connection string from .env.

volumes: - ./app:/app/app

Mounts local app folder inside the container.

Enables live reload during development.

üìÑ Updated docker-compose.yaml with Comments

# Docker Compose file format version

version: "3.8"

services:

# Main FastAPI application service

  video-manager:
    # Build image from Dockerfile in current directory
    build: .

    # Map host port 8000 to container port 8000
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

    # Pass MongoDB Atlas connection string from .env
    environment:
      - MONGO_URI=${MONGO_URI}

    # Mount local app folder for live reload during development
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app/app

üîÑ Why This Setup Works

Build ‚Üí Docker creates an image with dependencies + app code.
Run ‚Üí Compose starts the container.
Connect ‚Üí Port mapping exposes the API at localhost:8000.
Database ‚Üí App connects to MongoDB Atlas using .env.
Develop ‚Üí Volume mount enables live code reload.

‚úÖ Key Benefits

Isolation ‚Üí Runs in its own environment

Consistency ‚Üí Same setup across all machines

Portability ‚Üí Works on Windows, Mac, Linux

Dev-Friendly ‚Üí Live reload enabled

Simplicity ‚Üí Just run docker-compose up

üì¶ This setup gives you a containerized FastAPI app connected to MongoDB Atlas with live reload support for development.
